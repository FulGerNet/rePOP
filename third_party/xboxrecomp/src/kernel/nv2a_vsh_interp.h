/**
 * NV2A vertex program interpreter, for the software pushbuffer executor.
 *
 * The executor (nv2a_pb_exec.c) could only draw vertices that arrive already
 * in screen space. A title running vertex programs -- every 3D scene on the
 * Xbox -- sends model-space positions and lets the GPU transform them, so
 * those batches were counted and skipped. This runs the uploaded program on
 * the CPU, one vertex at a time, and hands back the outputs the rasteriser
 * needs.
 *
 * Programs and constants arrive through the pushbuffer exactly as the GPU
 * would take them (SET_TRANSFORM_PROGRAM_LOAD / _PROGRAM, _CONSTANT_LOAD /
 * _CONSTANT), so the executor forwards those methods here and nothing about
 * a title's D3D state has to be known.
 *
 * Instruction encoding: the field table at the top of nv2a_vsh_interp.c.
 * Portable C; no
 * graphics API.
